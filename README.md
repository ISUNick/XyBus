This project simulates a bus system with multiple stops and a set number of seats. 
It tracks passengers boarding and leaving at each stop, counts stranded passengers who cannot board, and records violations when more passengers try to get off than are on the bus. 
The bus supports both looping and backing routes, and service can be turned on or off at any stop.

The simulator handles all bus operations without using conditional statements, using arithmetic and a service flag to manage boarding, offboarding, and stranded passengers. 
It also allows retrieval of stop names, total passengers, total stranded, and total violations at any point.
